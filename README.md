# YouTube Search Extension

Welcome to the YouTube Search Extension! This is my first ever Chrome extension project, designed to make it easy to search selected text on YouTube directly from your browser.

## Features

- **Search on YouTube**: Right-click on any selected text in your browser and choose the "Search on YouTube" option from the context menu. This opens a new tab with YouTube search results for the selected text.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome.
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned or downloaded this repository.
6. The extension should now be installed and visible in your list of Chrome extensions.

## Usage

1. Select any text on a webpage.
2. Right-click on the selected text.
3. Choose the "Search on YouTube" option from the context menu.
4. A new tab will open with YouTube search results for the selected text.
